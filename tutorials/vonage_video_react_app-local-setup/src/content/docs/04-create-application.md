title: Create an Application in the Dashboard
---

You need a Vonage application with Video capabilities enabled. This application provides the credentials the app uses to authenticate with the Vonage Video API.

{% steps %}

1. Log in to the [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/).

2. Navigate to **Applications** from the main menu on the left.

3. Click **Create a new application**.

4. Fill in a **name** for your application (e.g., "Video React App").

5. Under **Authentication**, click **Generate public and private key**. This will automatically download the private key file — save it somewhere safe.

6. Scroll down to **Capabilities** and toggle on **Video**.

7. Click **Generate new application** to finish.

{% /steps %}

{% aside type="tip" %}
After creating the application, you will see your **Application ID** on the application details page. You will need this value in the next step.

{% aside type="caution" %}
Keep your private key file secure. You will need it to configure the backend environment. If you lose it, you can regenerate a new key pair from the application settings.
{% /aside %}

You have now created a Vonage application with Video enabled and obtained your Application ID and private key. Next, you'll configure the environment variables.
